Alpha Health System’s (insurance company) is an insurance compathat services approximately 5,000 patients with 100,000 claims. There are 500 providers and 40 facilities within the network.

Alpha Health System’s customer service department employs people who need quick access to various information while on phone calls. A (realistically internal) database driven website would make member(patient), claim, provider(doctor), and facility(clinic/hospital) information available to the customer service representatives for better customer service. This database will house information for Patient Claims Received by Providers and Facilities.
